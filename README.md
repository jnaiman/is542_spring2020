# IS542, Spring 2020 (taught online, synchronously)

This is a hastily assembled group of course materials for IS542 at the iSchool, UIUC.  Please excuse our dust.

If you see any bugs or errors please issue a PR -- always looking to make things better!

## Development Notes

As of writing, this github repo is very much under development **and** this course is still being taught so things in the last few weeks are moving around.  Check here for updates on the state of lectures.

 * Weeks 1-12 have been taught and code/lecture slides updated for this semester
 * Week 1-2 are fully ported to Github
 * Weeks 3-16 have no notebook files yet, only .R files and have not been "cleaned" for Github

## How to use this repo

Each week consists of lecture slides and prep-notebooks in the programming language R along with suggested resources, homeworks and readings.  The readings consist of what was "required" for the course as well as optional extra readings so feel free to take/leave what you'd like.

Below is the outline of the course, with links to the individual folders for each week.  Each folder contains (IN PROGRESS):
 1. an "README.md" file which lists the suggested readings and homeworks, datasets and any extra resources for the week
 1. The lecture slides (as a pdf)
 1. Prep coding notebooks used for the "live coding" portions of class which generally happened after the lecture portion (.ipynb files) **BUT** sometimes we swtich between the lecture slides & R.  This will be denoted in the slides as well as R.
 1. Any datasets used in the coding portion
 
**NOTE:** As this format of this course is currently being updated, some of the notebooks have not been converted and instead .R files are included instead.

## Reading

This course is based off of the following textbooks:

#### Required
   * [OIS]: OpenIntro Statistics, **3rd Edition** which can be found on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/OpenIntro-Statistics-CreateSpace-David-Diez/dp/1943450048/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=GM58G07HV34YWYGD0JRP) or in [free pdf form](http://www.tf.uns.ac.rs/~omorr/radovan_omorjan_003_prII/r-examples/os3.pdf).  **NOTE: we will likely move to the 4th Edition next semester.**
   * [ITR] An Introduction to R, available as a [pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).
   * [ISL] An Introduction to Statistical Learning, click on the `Download the PDF` link [here](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).
   
#### Optional
   * [MIS] [Intermediate Statistics with R](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2999) ([pdf link](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/2999/Greenwood_Book_2.1.pdf?sequence=9&isAllowed=y))
   * [STOR390] [STOR 390: Introduction to Data Science](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/) course page.


## Installation of R, RStudio and Jupyter notebooks

 1. Download R from the [R-project webpage](https://www.r-project.org/)
 1. Courses were taught using RStudio which you can [download right here](https://rstudio.com/)
 
 To run the Jupyter notebooks with R locally, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and then please follow the [instructions for installing R using the Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/).
 
 **NOTE:** There are pay-versions of this software but we assume you are using the free versions.

## TODO

 * Add in photos of RStudio & label panels
 * Link to Data ag install list?
 * Add in pedagogy links and general references
 * Add in "working on" as far as online teaching strategies -- what is currently working and is not
 * add in course pre-reqs
 
**Weeks**
 * Week 02
    * A-void notebook
	
**Stretch Goals**
 * include bayesian stuffs as a bonus class


### Disclaimer

My background is in astrophysics (hydro simulations) so there will be an abundance of astronomy examples and space jokes.  Also my spelling is atrocious. You have been warned.
