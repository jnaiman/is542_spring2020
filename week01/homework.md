# Week 01: Homework

#### Part 1: A survey 
 This was used to gather background of students, generate data for next week, left out here.
 
#### Part 2: an R exercise

This assignment can really help you get familiar with R and warming up for the topics we are about to discuss. Please perform statistical analysis on one dataset, you can use the attached dataset that shows a measure of heart rate for different activities (from http://www.statpoint.net/OpenSample.aspx). Please show how you handle the dataset and please considering calculating some **summary statistics** (mean, standard deviation, etc) and drawing **histograms**. Performing additional analysis is encouraged. 

The linked csv file is just for students who do not have the dataset in hand for any reason. You do NOT have to use this one.  CSV file: http://www.astronaiman.com/IS542F2018/hw1HRdata.csv 

To preserve the natural flow of the narrative, figures (e.g., screen shots, code snippets, etc) and tables should be embedded into your PDF document near the first mention.

**What is a narrative?**  See the example posted in todays class lecture.

**Note:** Please include what did & didn't work in your narrative PDF.  For example, if you can't get a bit of code to work let us know what you tried so we can see your work!
