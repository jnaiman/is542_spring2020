# Example Narratives (adapted from elliewix)

## Example narrative answers
Narrative answers should generally be around 50-100 words.  You may add more as desired, but it is not necessary for your grade.  Screenshots are also fine, but you don't need to give us a blow by blow for ever stage of solving the problem.  Also refer to the [syllabus](../IS542AO_syllabus.pdf) section on narratives for more info.

Below are three sample answers, showcasing a general style that we find helpful to read.  You are not limited to this style.  These are present mostly to showcase that you can have very short answers with a lot of information.

We will give you feedback about your narrative (too short or too long etc) first about any changes needed, and won't take points off until we know that a) you've received this feedback before that submission, and b) you have not made a content change after a direct request to change.  

There is no upper limit for the narrative answers, so you won't lose points for it being too long.  But there is zero benefit for giving us a huge answer.

These examples are for individual questions, and labeled for what we are showcasing.  So your narrative will be a collection of answers like this.  Generally they should be about 1-3 pages, depending on the length of the homework.  Some homeworks will have problems you are directed to answer within your narrative, which do not require a separate narrative answer.
