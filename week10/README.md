# Week 10: Hypothesis testing: Differences of 2 means/proportions, paired data; ANOVA and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi^2"> models

This week we continue with hypothesis for differences between two means and proportions and paired data.  We'll also cover hypothesis testing using ANOVA and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi^2"> models.

## Reading

OIS Ch. 4.5, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 6.2, 6.3

**Optional** Reading: MIS 2.5, MIS 5 (esp. 5.9) for chi-squared, MIS 3-4 for ANOVA (esp. 4.2).  Both Ch. 5 and Ch. 3-4 in MIS go into a LOT more detail than we are going to.
