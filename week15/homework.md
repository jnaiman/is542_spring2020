# Week 14: Homework

**Part #1:** ISL 5.4.3

**Part #2:** Go through lab 6.6 and write this up as an R-file.  Include a few short sentences about 1 or more interesting things you learned.  The purpose of this exercise is to get some hands-on experience using both the lasso & ridge regression we briefly mentioned in class & an intro to using CV to pick the best "lambda" parameter (we'll discuss these topics more next week).

**Part #3:** After going through lab 6.6 discuss in your own words (~100-200) what the "lambda" parameter is doing in the lasso and ridge regressions and how it is different than a "regular" least squares regression.
