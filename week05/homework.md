# Week 05: Homework

### Part 1: 
Please write up your answers to the following problems from OpenIntro Statistics in the "Exercises" Section of Chapter 3 (section 3.6): 3.2, 3.10, 3.12, 3.16

### Part 2: 

Note: there are notes (which we got to in the last part of class) in the Part 4 R-script posted on the Moodle page for this week - feel free to use these as a guide for this part. 

Read in or simulate a dataset that looks like it might be normal, and use some of the methods described in class to determine how close to normal it is.   You may use any dataset, but feel free to use the "UN fish dataset" we used in previous weeks if no others are of interest.

If using the UN fish dataset, you might want to start by constructing a variable that is equal to the base-10 log of the "Trade (USD)" variable (i.e. myVar = log10(trade_usd)) and figuring out if this new variable is normal.  This is what is done in the Part-4 script uploaded on the Moodle page for this week.

### Part 3: 
Assume for a moment that the dataset you read in in Part 2 is normal and answer a few questions: (1) what is the observation (or "physical x" value) that corresponds to a Z-score of -1.0?  (2) What is the percentile that corresponds to a Z-score of -1.0?  (3) Given that your distribution is likely not perfectly normal, do you think the measurement of the percentile in (2) is greater or smaller than the actual percentage of the area under the curve of your distribution with Z-scores less than -1?  Why?
