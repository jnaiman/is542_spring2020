# Week 11: Linear Regression

Today we'll cover our first case of model-fitting: Linear Regression.

## Reading

Linear Regression: OIS Ch. 7 & ISL 3.0 - 3.1

**Optional** Reading: MIS Ch 7.

Note: The rest of the class will be some "Machine Learning" methods and concepts.  If you want to continue on with this after class, I recommend "Hands-On Machine Learning" - it is Python based: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491962291 or the 2nd edition with Tensorflow 2).  If you get this book, Ch. 1 & 2 are good introductions to these sorts of processes.  

Packages to install (with command: install.packages("PACKAGE_NAME") or install.packages(PACKAGE_NAME) ):
