# Week 02: Homework

The purpose of this assignment is to get you used to using R as we will be using it extensively throughout the class.

#### Part 1: 
ITR Appendix A: Write up all commands, test them and save as an .R file. Write up an account of your experiment with these commands.  Note: you don't have to add anything else in this part besides writing up the R code that is presented in the book & commenting on any issues or points of interest in your narrative PDF, this is to force you to use some of the functions we'll be dealing with later in the class.

#### Part 2: 
ITR Scan chapters 5,6,7,12 and identify an R command or function that looks particularly interesting, strange, or useful to you. Experiment with it and write up an account of your investigation.
