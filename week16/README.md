# Week 16: Lasso Regression with CV, Intro to Unsupervised learning (PCA)

We'll keep thinking about Lasso/Ridge regression for Linear Regression, think a little bit about unsupervised learning, and talk about "where to go from here".


## Class outline

 1. [Lecture](lecture16_s2020_toupload.pdf)
 1. [Notebook: Intro to CV using KNN](prep_knn_to_CV_part1.ipynb)
