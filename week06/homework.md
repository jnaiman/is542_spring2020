# Week 06: Homework

#### Part 1: 
Please write up your answers to the following problems from OpenIntro Statistics in the "Exercises" Section of Chapter 3 (section 3.6 of chapter 3): 3.20, 3.22, 3.26, 3.28, 3.30, 3.36 

#### Part 2: 
How many other civilizations are there in the Milky Way galaxy?  Use the Drake equation to find out.  See the [attached slides](drakeEqHW.pdf) & [starter R-file](starter_drake_forHW.R) to get going.  Specifically answer:

  1. If SETI (https://www.seti.org/) observes 1000 stars, what is the probability they'll find at least 10 civilizations?  Or just 1?  What if they observe 100,000 stars?

  2. What is the mean number of civilizations you think they will find? What is the standard deviation? 

Note: there is a range of each parameter that goes into the Drake equation, so feel free to chose based on how optimistic or pessimistic you are!
