# Instructor Notes: Week 04

## Goals

 * Understand the basic addition/multiplication/conditional probability laws
 * Practice using tree diagrams to invert probabilities
 * Overview of random variables: Expectation, varience
 
## Class Overview

Students begin the week's lecture by playing the Beat the Odds game - in groups (on-campus) or in breakout rooms (online).
 * Get hands-on experience with probability laws "in action"
 * Online: chance to "meet" each other
 
Lecture & examples on tree diagrams
 * allows students to tackle more complex probability problems
 * examples in lecture allow students to work through these problems as a class
 
Lecture & examples on random variables
 * sets foundation for adding variances later
 
## Assessments

 1. Listen in on the Beat the Odds game -- who is doing the talking and solving?
 1. Polls/chat window for each problem (give students 2-4 min per problem).
 
 
## Online 

Give students ample time to play Beat the Odds (~15 min).  Go between breakout groups pretty frequently to see how students are doing.

Set a google timer for 2-4 min for each problem assigned in class (for tree diagrams & random variables).

Zoom:
 * there is no history saved in breakout room chats -- make sure you spend enough time in each room to get a feel for what issues students may have
