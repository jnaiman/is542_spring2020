# Week 14: Homework

ISL: 4.7.10g-i ignoring LDA.  For (h) you will have to refer back to the results you got from the last homework,

and

ISL: 4.7.13 ignoring LDA.  Here "describe your findings" should include plots showing your classifications and boundaries (you can use the code we went over in class today).

For a warmup, you can try ISL Labs 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.5.  You do *NOT* have to turn anything in on these labs.
